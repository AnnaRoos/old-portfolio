# Portfolio
Early portfolio site made during Hyper Island's Frontend developer program.

The site displays some of my first projects in development, as well as samples from my career as a journalist and pictures from some previous exhibitions at my art gallery.

This site includes lots of CSS animations, some parallax images and an intersection observer.
