# Portfolio
A Hyper Island school project.

Early portfolio site made at the Frontend developer program during fall 2020.

The site displays some of my first projects in development, as well as samples from my career as a journalist and pictures from some previous exhibitions at my art gallery.

This site includes lots of CSS animations, some parallax images and an intersection observer.
